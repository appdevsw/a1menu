To install the menu on Debian or Ubuntu derivatives you can use *.deb packages from the last release.
Look at https://github.com/appdevsw/a1menu/releases.

Download the appropriate amd64 or i386 version, and install it using dpkg.

e.g.	sudo dpkg -i ./a1menu-amd64-beta2.deb

In other distros you can do I manually.
Download DEB file and use unpackdeb.sh to extract and install menu files.

e.g. sudo ./unpackdeb.sh ./a1menu-amd64-beta2.deb.
