The a1menu is written in Qt Creator and Qt Designer v4.8.
In this Github repository there is no automated scripts building binaries from sources yet.
Also, there is no source files automatically generated by Qt IDE (eg. moc_*.cpp and ui_*.h files)
So, if you want to bild compile the project, you should install and use Qt Creator.
